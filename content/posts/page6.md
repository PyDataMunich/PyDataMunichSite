The topic of the talk will be good practices in information design for scientific figures, and how to implement them with standard Python tools. I will cover more advanced methods of visualising 1, 2 and 3-dimesional data using matplotlib (with an emphasis on the object-oriented interface) and seaborn, as well as interactivity with ipywidgets and pyqtgraph.
