Speaker: Achilleas Koutsou

Come level up your Python skills!

In this session, we will teach you the little things (and maybe some big things) that will increase your productivity when coding with Python.

Are you a new Python user that wants to learn what nice tricks the language has to offer? Perhaps you're a Python user that just wants to better understand what the language is doing for you and what more it can offer. Or maybe you're a programmer skilled in other languages that wants to learn why some of us love Python.

We'll help you better understand the parts of Python you probably already know, or introduce you to some aspects of the language you weren't aware of.
