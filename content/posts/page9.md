Speaker: Michael Volkmore

Python is a powerful "glue" language for controlling external programs from the command line and a potent(ial) substitute as well complement to UNIX shell scripts. I will talk about calling command line programs using the subprocess module, working with stdin/stdout, the file system and explain Python command line argument parsing. In addition I will provide examples for automating otherwise interactive tasks as retrieving web pages, reading/writing configuration files, sending/receiving email or scripting ssh connections using the Python standard lib and some extra modules.
