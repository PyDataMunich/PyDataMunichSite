As your coding project grows, saving your work and keeping track of all the changes that you've made becomes more and more important.  Git is a popular versional control system that works with all programming languages, used for saving changes to your code, making backups of your code, and collaborating with others!

In this 90-minute workshop, led by Dr. Joseph Donovan, we'll learn the basics of Git in a fun, hands-on group setting.  Bringing your own laptops with Git installed (https://git-scm.com/download) is reccommended, but additionally laptops will be provided for anyone that forgets.  So join us!

(Oh, and this time there's beer!)
