PyData and Super Python Talks are back online! To kick off the new semester, we'll be reviewing DataFrames with Pandas and showing how using long-format tables can simplify complex data filtering and grouping operations, which we'll demonstrate to make elegant data visualization and statistics code with the Seaborn and Statsmodels packages!
