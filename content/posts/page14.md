Speaker: Giacomo Debidda

PyData and Super Python Talks are back with another accessible data science tutorial, this time by Giacomo Debidda and at the LMU Biozentrum in Planegg! HDF5 is a file format and a data model designed to store large amounts of data used by many top universities, agencies, and research institutes. Let's get familiar with this file format. In this talk, we will learn how to create, manipulate and perform superfast, in-kernel queries on big HDF5 data files with Python's "h5py", "PyTables", and "numexpr" packages. Join us!

Schedule:

  - 6:30pm: Doors Open
  - 7pm: Lighting Talk: TBA
  - 7:20pm: Tutorial by Giacomo Debidda: High Performance Data Analysis with Big HDF5 Files in Python
