# Welcome to PyData Munich!


As our little community grows and needs more and more infrastructure, I though a
centralized web site (written with Python, of course) might make for a nice info
spot for new members, organizers, and sponsors.  

My hope is that this site will be useful for advertising and summarizing events,
as well as providing links to the various media (github repositories, jupyter notebooks,
videos, web links, etc) that are being produced throughout our events.  Keep an eye
on this page for new news, and subscribe to our various pages for announcements on
new tutorials coming up!  

Anyway, it's been a fun project, and I've learned a lot about Pelican, a Python static web generators
by building this site.  Looking forward to the future--see you at our next event!

Best wishes,

Nick
