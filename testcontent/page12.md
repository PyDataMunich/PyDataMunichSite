PyData and Super Python Talks are back with another accessible data science tutorial! There is a lot of data out there on the internet, but it's not always in an easy-to-consume format. Luckily, there are a lot of "web scraping" tools out there to help us! These tools take the data and put it into a more structured format, like CSV or Excel. In this talk, Nithish Raghunandanan will show us how to use Scrapy and BeautifulSoup, two powerful web scraping packages for Python, to grab and collect customer contact information from yellow pages web sites!

Schedule:

• 6:30pm: Doors Open

• 7pm: Lighting Talk: Data Science at TNG Consulting

• 7:15pm: Tutorial by Nithish Raghunandanan: Scraping Data from the Web with Python using Scrapy and BeautifulSoup
